    "# Estimating the depth for classical simulability for QAOA under depolarizing noise\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to clarify how the estimats in Table X of [\"Limitations of optimization algorithms on noisy quantum devices\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05532.pdf) were produced. In that table, we estimated the maximal depth before a noisy quantum computer performing the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has a performance that is similar to simple Monte Carlo algorithms when performing optimization of Ising models. The choice of models we analysed was inspired by the recent experiments of [\"Quantum Approximate Optimization of Non-Planar Graph Problems on a Planar Superconducting Processor\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04197).\n",
    "We refer to our paper [\"Limitations of optimization algorithms on noisy quantum devices\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05532.pdf) for a technical discussion of the concepts introduced here. The notebook will solely show how to obtain a maximal depth estimate given the relevant parameters of the problem and the device. These are the noise rates of the device for layers of 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates, how many physical layers of 2-qubit gates are required for each layer of 2-qubit QAOA and...\n",
    "After that, for each example, the notebook will output a table with the estimates given by our methods. If you do not change the values presented here, it should yield the values shown in Table.\n",

    "This is arguably the simplest class of examples considered in [\"Quantum Approximate Optimization of Non-Planar Graph Problems on a Planar Superconducting Processor\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04197).\n",

    "The first numbers we need to perform the estimate are how many layers of 1-qubit gates and 2-qubit gates are required to perform one layer of the QAOA unitary. In case the topology of the problem does not match the device's, it is usually necessary to perform a number of layers that scales with the number of qubits, which we will denote by $n$. We will call the number of 1-qubit layers by $L_1(n)$ and 2-qubit $L_2(n)$. For the experiment, they were given by XX, as we set below.\n",
